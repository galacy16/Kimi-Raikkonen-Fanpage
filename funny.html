                    <p>One of Formula 1&#146s most iconic and famous names bows out of the sport at the end of this season, with Kimi Räikkönen announcing his retirement from the grid earlier this season.
                        Kimi Räikkönen is renowned for not saying much in or out of the car, but behind the wheel, and behind the reporters microphones his plain-spoken (occasionally a little too plain-spoken) radio messages and interviews have become the stuff of legend.
                        The Flying Finn has accrued a cult-like following over the years for his blistering pace and succinct approach to the media, never saying more than he needs to and quite often being more than comfortable to show sheer disdain for the circus that surrounds the pinnacle of motorsport.
                        Ultimately, he's a driver that's purely been in the sport to drive the finest machines on the planet and, with a world title under his belt and several other iconic victories and championship challenges to boot, you'd have to say he did a pretty good job whilst he was in the field.
                        Superb on the track and equally as amusing off it, we run down a few of his most iconic moments in Formula 1 as the curtain begins to fall on the career of the sport's most experienced star.
